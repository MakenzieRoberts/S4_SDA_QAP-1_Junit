## Simple Junit Testing

**Instructions:**

 - Start with a new maven based Java project.

 - Implement unit test for the objects you built for your first Java QAP. We covered one test case for the Account object in class, so Iâ€™d like you to complete the test cases for that class and add tests for the Timer class. You will need to add your code from your Java QAP to the maven project. You can simply copy and paste that.
